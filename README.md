# PenMe

For our Web Application, powered by Firebase, PenMe, we have implemented User Authentication, Event Creation, Google Calendar Integration, and of course, an Algorithm to select the best times to meet with others, based on their calendar events. PenMe was built using the Bootstrap Framework and the use of the following languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The web application as it stands is around 4,500 lines of code. 

<h2>Home Page </h2>

Note: When there are multiple participants, PenMe automatically checks their calendar events that have been added/imported to PenMe and then automatically lists options for scheduling the optimal meeting time.

<h2>Google Calendar Integration </h2>

We have implemented the ability to import events from Google Calendar to easily set up your events with PenMe, with the option to manually sync events. We hope to add more third party services, such as Outlook.
